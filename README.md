# AI-based optimization in expedition planning-a practice-oriented workshop

The workshop https://schedule.jcon.one/session/894517


Local AI models are becoming increasingly important in modern software development, 
especially in areas that require offline-capable, data-protection-friendly, 
and powerful systems. In this workshop, we examine how local AI models 
with Ollama and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can be integrated into 
existing Java applications to carry out data-driven optimizations.

The open-source project "Expedition Planner", a Java-based web application for planning 
and organizing expeditions, serves as the playground. The workshop aims to develop 
an AI-based optimization component that analyzes and automatically improves expedition 
tasks and equipment lists using RAG. Technologies such as Langchain4j are used to integrate 
Ollama models and RAG seamlessly.

At the end of the workshop, the participants understand how to 
integrate and use local AI models and RAG in Java-based applications. 
We develop our AI expansion for the expedition Planner, offering data-based 
optimization options. In addition, we learn how LLMS can be used productively 
within a closed infrastructure without relying on external cloud services.
